Congratulations on installing everything. 

To view your running validator type the following commands.
/blockchain/tmux_logviewer.sh

To remove everything installed run "sudo /blockchain/stop_remove_images.sh" command then delete the /blockchain directory then delete the install directory under your home. 

If you reboot your computer everything will start back up automatically.

Run sudo /blockchain/stop_remove_images.sh to stop this from happening but keeping all the files.
