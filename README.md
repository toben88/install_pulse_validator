## Interactive Setup
Pulse-Chain Validator node - this will spin up all the stuff you need to install for a pulsechain validator.

## Installing and Running Pulse Node with the option to add the lighthouse-validator

This guide will help you install and run the Pulse Node using the single command for ubuntu and debian by a single command. 

donations acceptable so I might be able to work on other stuff as wellðŸ˜ƒ

## Prerequisites

- A Unix-based operating system that supports apt (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian)
- Suggested 32 GB Ram
- 1 TB HD or greater. Suggested 1.2 TB or greater
- User account that has sudo capabilities. (Default when installing ubuntu desktop)

# - Installation Steps -

### 1. Run a single command to install all wget, libraries, dockers, git etc to run a validator.

Open terminal and go to where you want to download stuff to. Default is /home/username
Run the following command either as a single line:
```bash
sudo apt install git && git clone https://github.com/toben88/install_pulse_validator && cd install_pulse_validator && chmod +x install_pulse_val.sh && sudo ./install_pulse_val.sh && cat info.txt
```

Or run as the following 4 lines if you can't see all of this.
1. 
```bash
sudo apt install git
```
2. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/toben88/install_pulse_validator
```
3.
```bash
cd install_pulse_validator && chmod +x install_pulse_val.sh
```
4. 
```bash
sudo ./install_pulse_val.sh
```


### 2. Clone the repository

Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to download the repository. Then, use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tdslaine/install_pulse_node
```
### 3. Change directory

Change to the `install_pulse_node` directory:

```bash
  cd install_pulse_node
```

### 4. Modify script permissions

Give execution permissions to the `setup_pulse_node.sh` script:

```bash
  chmod +x setup_pulse_node.sh
```

### 5. Run the script

Finally, run the `setup_pulse_node.sh` script:
```bash
  sudo ./setup_pulse_node.sh
```

### 6. After the setup is complete

The setup will create several start_###.sh scripts inside the folder you chose in the setup (default: /blockchain), these are:

```bash
start_execution.sh
start_consensus.sh
start_validator.sh
```

There will also be a copy of three helper_scripts to ease up the task of stopping, viewing/following logs and updating the Docker Images/Containers. Read bellow for further informaion

# - Launching, Logging, and Stopping the Execution, Beacon and Validator Docker-Containers -

## Launching:

! This only applies if you didn't choose to autostart the scripts during the setup script when asked if you want to start them now !

After completing the initial setup, you will have to run each start_###.sh script at least once manually. Once you have done so, the Docker container will automatically restart in the event of a reboot or crash, without requiring manual intervention. You will only need to run the scripts manually again if you have manually stopped the containers.

cd into the folder you provided in the setup (default: /blockchain) f.e.:

```bash
cd /blockchain

./start_execution.sh
./start_consensus.sh
./start_validator.sh
```

## Logging:

To view the log files for the execution, beacon, and validator after a reboot you can use the provided log_viewer.sh or tmux_logviewer.sh script that should be inside the folder you chose in the setup (default: /blockchain) You can also use sepperate commands inside a terminal:

### A) via script:
There are two version available:
1. log_viewer.sh for GUI-Ubuntu
2. tmux_logviewer.sh for terminal-based environments (please get to know on how to control tmux prior).

The script should already be executable, if not make the script executable via:

```bash
cd /blockhain
sudo chmod +x log_viewer.sh
```
or

```bash
cd /blockhain
sudo chmod +x tmux_logviewer.sh
```
run the script:

```bash
cd /blockchain
./log_viewer.sh
```

or

```bash
cd /blockchain
./tmux_logviewer.sh
```

### B) single commands:
```bash
sudo docker logs -f execution
sudo docker logs -f beacon
sudo docker logs -f validator
```

## Stopping Containers:

Should you need to alter the original start_###.sh scripts you might need to stop/restart the docker-containers/images that are currently running. To achieve this, you can use the stop_remove_images.sh script provided which should be inside the folder you chose in the setup (default: /blockchain).

### A) via script:

The script should already be executable, if not make the script executable via:

```bash
cd /blockchain

sudo chmod +x stop_remove_images.sh
```

run the script:
```bash
cd /blockchain

./stop_remove_images.sh
```

### B) singel commands:

```bash
sudo docker stop execution
sudo docker stop beacon
sudo docker stop validator
```

```bash
sudo docker -rm execution
sudo docker -rm beacon
sudo docker -rm validator
```

Once the containers are stopped, you might also need to prune/clean the cache using the command:

```bash
sudo docker container prune
```

After you made desired changes, you can start the Docker Images/Containers again with the initial start_###.sh scripts from within the folder you chose in the setup (default: /blockchain):

```bash
cd /blockchain

./start_execution.sh
./start_consensus.sh
./start_validator.sh
```

# - Changing flags/options  -

If you ever find yourself in the need to change/add/remove some option-flags or alter the config you can achieve this by first stopping the docker-images/containers, then editing the start_###.sh script as you desire. You can use any editor available, just make sure you run these as sudo to be able to save changes inside the .sh file. Also pay attention to end each line with a \ 

1. Stop containers via provided script or manually as described above.
2. Edit desired start_###.sh script

```bash
cd \blockchain

sudo nano start_execution.sh
```

3. save changes
4. restart the docker container-images as described above manually.


## - Updating the Docker-Images should pulse-devs update clients etc. -

To update your Docker containers/images you can use the provided the watchtower.sh script which can be found inside the folder you chose in the setup (default: /blockchain):

The script should already be executable, if not make the script executable via::

```bash
cd /blockchain

chmod +x watchtower.sh
```

### 2. Run the script: 

```bash
cd /blockchain

./watchtower.sh
```
### 3. Review the output: 

The script will automatically check for updates and update the necessary containers and images. Review the output of the script to ensure that the update process was successful.

### Please note that the watchtower.sh script might require administrative privileges to execute, depending on your system's settings. If necessary, use sudo to run the script with elevated privileges:

``` bash
cd /blockchain

sudo ./watchtower.sh
```
